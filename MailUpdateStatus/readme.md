# MailUpdateStatus

I created these scripts to facilitate the work of monitoring the status of Windows Updates via ConfigMgr.

With the script, you don't have to sit and work more than necessary when it comes to keeping track of the patches every month.
## scriptconfig.xml
The first file in the folder is "scriptconfig.xml" which contains everything the scripts need to run. With that file, you don't have to open and edit any of the script more than necessary, or rather only if you can rename "scriptconfig.xml" to something else or put it somewhere else...but why ?
